while the texture is perfect, it seems that some of the color is off between the original wall texture and the dirtied one
just take some of the green tint off the dirtied one and it should be good as gold

If I could add, it all looks too green. All of it. I'd suggest making the colour either white or very light cream, as the green messes a lot with the lighting.
